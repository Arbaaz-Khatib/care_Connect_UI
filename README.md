# care_Connect_UI

A platform where speciliazed health care seekers can connect with experienced care providers, this was a freelance project which I worked on in DEC-2022.

The client wanted a working UI components for interactive forms, a profile info page & list of user's profiles.   

As per the requirement I created animated checkboxes, stylized input's & card styled profile components that can be implemented.
